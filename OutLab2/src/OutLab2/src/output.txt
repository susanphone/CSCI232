On average the strategy that works best is best fit decreasing. First fit works best when all items are close to
capacity or if most items are a multiple of the capacity. And worst case works about as well as best fit, but
worst case is not as good at fitting smaller items because the smaller items with take spots that could be used for
bigger items. As opposed to best fit, which will try to fit the smaller items into almost full containers,
but it would take longer for best fit to find an open bin for larger items on the list.
